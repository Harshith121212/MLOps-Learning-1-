# Medical Charges Linear Regression
This project explores the relationship between medical charges and patient data using linear regression.

## Overview
- Dataset: Medical charges dataset (age, BMI, smoker status, etc.)
- Performed data visualization with Plotly and Seaborn
- Built linear regression models using:
  - Manual parameter tuning
  - Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE

## Goal
To understand how factors like age, BMI, and smoking influence medical charges and build simple prediction models.
